# SQL Data Analysis Portfolio
**Drug side effects analysis**

This project explores the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs using the “Drug Labels & Side Effects Dataset” from Kaggle. The dataset contains 1,400+ records with information about drug names, manufacturers, dosage forms, dosage amounts, and reported side effects.

The goal of this project is to analyze drug safety profiles, identify patterns in side effects, and showcase SQL and data analysis skills applied to a biologically relevant dataset.

**Dataset Description & Source** 

Name: Drug Labels & Side Effects Dataset | 1400+ Records

Source: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/drug-labels-and-side-effects-dataset)

This project uses the Drug Labels & Side Effects Dataset, which contains over 1,400 records of pharmaceutical drug information. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and provides structured details on medications, their manufacturers, dosage forms and amounts, as well as associated side effects. Side effects are recorded as comma-separated values, making it possible to explore relationships between drugs and their reported adverse reactions.

| **Column Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| drug_name | Name of the pharmaceutical drug. |
| manufacturer | Company that produces the drug. |
| dosage_form | Form and amount of the drug (e.g., tablet, injection, mg dosage). |
| administration_route | Route of administration for the drug (e.g., oral, intravenous, topical). |
| side_effects | Reported side effects, listed as comma-separated values per drug entry. |
| side_effect_severity | Severity label of each reported side effect (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). |
