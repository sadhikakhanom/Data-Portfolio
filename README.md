# SQL Data Analysis Portfolio
Drug side effects analysis

This project explores the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs using the “Drug Labels & Side Effects Dataset” from Kaggle. The dataset contains 1,400+ records with information about drug names, manufacturers, dosage forms, dosage amounts, and reported side effects.

The goal of this project is to analyze drug safety profiles, identify patterns in side effects, and showcase SQL and data analysis skills applied to a biologically relevant dataset.
